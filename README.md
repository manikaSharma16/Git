# Git

How to backup your project?
Don't back up at all?
Or use zip?

Even better: Use version control system: Git(a command line tool)

Version refers to state of the project: Like how we used to keep: Project, ProjectFinal, ProjectFinal1.0, etc

Github: Makes use of Git behind the scenes and provides us a nice looking UI
