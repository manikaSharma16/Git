# Git

How to backup your project?
Don't back up at all?
Or use zip?

Even better: Use version control system: Git(a command line tool)

Version refers to state of the project: Like how we used to keep: Project, ProjectFinal, ProjectFinal1.0, etc

Github: Makes use of Git behind the scenes and provides us a nice looking UI

Repository: Project folder
When we use git, we can colloborate with many people on our repository

Unversioned files: (Come in red): These files won't be backed up
Versioned files: (Come in green): These files will be backed up
